# Chinese Numeric Digits Classification

This is a project for classifying Chinese numeric digits using the Chinese-MNIST dataset and a dense neural network.

## Description

The Chinese-MNIST dataset contains 15,000 images of handwritten Chinese numeric digits, each represented by a unique Chinese character. The goal of this project is to create and train a dense neural network to correctly classify these digits.

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas

You can install these libraries using pip: <pip install -r requirements.txt>
